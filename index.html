                <strong>
                Happiness cannot be bought , it is earned by finding it in the smallest and most humble actions in our life . Being in the past and comparing yourself with others are the two factors that stop us from being happy . Being what others tell you may earn you money , fam, respect and many other things , but it cannot earn you happiness . The first key is ignoring what other people say . Secondly, do what you like. For example, I like to listen as well as learn music which refreshes my soul, brain and body . I like to take part in open activities like debates and discussions in which I am able to fully express myself with no bounds . Third factor is living in the present . There are only two days on which nothing can be done , one is yesterday and the other is tomorrow . Every moment you spend in the past or the future , you are wasting that moment in present . The final factor is to compete with yourself . Comparing yourself with others may give you a feeling of frustration or overconfidence which will always drown you in the sea of destruction . I also track my own progress of a specific time period rather than comparing myself to somebody else's achievements . These are just some of the factors which when applied in our life , can get us the priceless happiness which we all seek for .
